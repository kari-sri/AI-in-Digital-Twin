## Project Summary Analysis
Digital Twins are dynamic digital replicas of physical entities that combine sensor data, historical records, and predictive models to provide continuous monitoring and decision support. The reviewed paper argues that embedding AI into Digital Twins transforms raw telemetry into actionable predictions (predictive maintenance, anomaly detection), supports closed-loop automation, and enables new business and sustainability models.
